# DIY-Instagram-filters


I've developed a DIY solution that adds warmth and cool tones to live videos and photos, adjusts brightness dynamically.
One of the highlights of this project was creating a filter reminiscent of Instagram's popular Paris filter. By analyzing color schemes and applying advanced filtering techniques, I was able to replicate the aesthetic appeal of the original filter, adding a touch of creativity to my project.
Additionally, I implemented image blurring and edge detection using the Canny algorithm, further expanding my skills in image processing. These features not only added depth to the project but also helped me gain a deeper understanding of complex image manipulation techniques.
This project has been an exciting journey, allowing me to explore the creative possibilities of image processing while solidifying my fundamentals in the field.
